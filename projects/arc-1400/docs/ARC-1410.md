# ARC-1410: Partitioned Token Balances (Draft)

Status: Draft  
Category: Standard Track  
Created: 2025-09-03  
Part of: ARC-1400 Suite  
Depends On: ARC-1594  
Author(s): Ludovit Scholtz

## 1. Abstract

ARC-1410 defines partitioned balances for Algorand security tokens. Partitions allow segregating holdings (e.g., unrestricted, locked, escrow, tranche A/B) while preserving a single ARC-200 token supply. Each partition acts as a logical sub-ledger with rules influencing transfer eligibility.

## 2. Motivation

Regulated assets often require lock-ups and categorization of units. Instead of deploying multiple ARC-200 tokens, partitions provide granular control, improved UX, and simplified corporate actions (single total supply). Ethereum's ERC-1410 informs this ARC; we adapt to Algorand state constraints and atomic group mechanics.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Partition Identifier

A partition is identified by an ARC-4 `address` (not a 32-byte arbitrary hash). Divergence from ERC-1410: Ethereum permits `bytes32` (or shorter labels hashed); ARC-1410 fixes the identifier to an address to enable:

- Native authorization (partition controller / escrow account as identifier)
- Reuse of address indexing infra
- Clear zero-address semantics for the default/unrestricted partition

Implementations MAY map human-readable labels to partition addresses via a registry box `partition-labels` storing tuples `(label -> address)`.

### 3.2 State Representation

Two recommended models:

1. Local State Mapping: Each account's local state stores per-partition balances under truncated keys (e.g., first 8 bytes of partition address) when partition count is small (<8 due to schema limits).
2. Boxes: Each holder has a box named `p-<addr>-<partitionAddr>` storing a `uint64` balance (msgpack encoded). Preferred for scalable partition counts.

A global box `partitions` MAY store an indexed list of active partition addresses and optional metadata (label, flags).

### 3.3 Invariants

For every account: `Î£ partitionBalances == ARC-200 balance`. Contract logic MUST enforce this on issuance, redemption, and transfers. Discrepancies MUST trigger failure.

### 3.4 Balance Semantics

Clarifications relative to ERC-1410 behavior:

- Moving units between partitions (e.g., release from locked to unrestricted) MUST NOT change the holder's total ARC-200 balance; it's a reclassification only.
- A partition move operation MUST debit the source partition balance and credit the destination partition balance in the same atomic group as (or instead of) any ARC-200 unit movement so the invariant holds every step.
- Plain ARC-200 (ARC-200 standard) transfers that occur without partition context MUST be defined by implementation policy. Recommended rule: they operate on the default/unrestricted (zero-address) partition ONLY. If the sender does not have enough units in that default partition, the transfer MUST fail (rather than implicitly draining other partitions) to avoid silent regulatory bypass.
- Implementations MAY forbid bare ARC-200 transfers entirely (forcing `arc1410_transfer_by_partition`) by having the ARC-200 logic route through the application; this MUST be clearly documented if chosen.
- Receiving units via a plain ARC-200 transfer credits only the default/unrestricted partition under the recommended rule above. It MUST NOT auto-spread across other partitions.
- Partition-aware issuance/redemption (`arc1410_issue_by_partition`, `arc1410_redeem_by_partition`) directly adjust both the ARC-200 total and the specified partition balance.

### 3.5 Methods (ABI Recommendations)

(All snake*case with ARC-4 types; `partition: address`. ARC-1410 methods are namespaced with `arc1410*`.)

- `arc1410_total_supply() -> (amount: uint256)`
- `arc1410_balance_of_partition(holder: address, partition: address) -> (amount: uint256)`
- `arc1410_partitions_of(holder: address, page: uint64) -> (partitions: address[])` (MAY paginate if large. if not, page = 0)
- `arc1410_transfer_by_partition(from: address, partition: address, to: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes) -> (receiverPartition: address)`
- `arc1410_issue_by_partition(to: address, partition: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes)`
- `arc1410_redeem_by_partition(from: address, partition: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes)`
- `arc1410_set_partition_flag(partition: address, flag_key: bytes, value: uint64)`

### 3.6 Transfer Semantics

`arc1410_transfer_by_partition` MUST internally call or replicate ARC-1594 validation logic including partition-specific flags:

- Transferable flag absent or zero -> return code `12` PartitionRestricted.
- Check sender partition balance.
- Adjust sender + recipient partition balances atomically with ARC-200 movement (inner transaction or paired ARC-200 transfer).

If `partition` is the zero address it denotes the default/unrestricted partition when such a concept is used.

### 3.7 Discovery

Wallets & indexers discover partitions via:

1. Reading global `partitions` box.
2. Querying `arc1410_partitions_of`.

### 3.8 Events (Logs)

- Tag 0x11 arc1410_partition_transfer | from | to | partition(address) | amount
- Tag 0x12 arc1410_partition_issue | to | partition(address) | amount
- Tag 0x13 arc1410_partition_redeem | from | partition(address) | amount

### 3.9 Merging / Splitting

Optional methods MAY allow migrating balances between partitions with issuer authorization (e.g., releasing locked units).

### 3.10 Cost Considerations

Use boxes to avoid local state schema inflation for large partition sets. Batch operations (e.g., multi-partition redemption) can be structured as multiple app calls in a group.

## 4. Security Considerations

- Prevent creation of unauthorized partitions (maintain an allowlist of partition addresses).
- Avoid address reuse for unrelated semantic partitions without proper migration flows.
- Ensure merging logic cannot bypass lock-ups (validate destination partition flags).

## 5. Reference Implementation

Planned in `smart_contracts/security_token` module.

## 6. Backwards Compatibility

Applications not aware of partitions can treat the zero address partition as canonical, reading ARC-200 balance minus sum of restricted partitions if exposed.
