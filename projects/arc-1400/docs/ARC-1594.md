# ARC-1594: Core Security Token Operations (Draft)

Status: Draft  
Category: Standard Track  
Created: 2025-09-03  
Part of: ARC-1400 Suite  
Depends On: ARC88 (Ownable), ARC-200 (ERC-20 port)  
Author(s): Ludovit Scholtz

## 1. Abstract

ARC-1594 specifies core issuance, redemption, and transfer validation semantics for security tokens on Algorand. It provides deterministic pre-transfer checks and standardized status / error codes enabling wallets, exchanges, and compliance services to integrate with regulated token flows.

## 2. Motivation

Security tokens require pre-trade eligibility checks (KYC/AML, jurisdiction, lock-up expirations) that are not expressible purely via permissionless transfers. ERC-1594 defines these on Ethereum; this ARC maps them to Algorand leveraging atomic transaction groups and AVM logic for predictable, low-latency enforcement.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Interfaces (ABI Recommendations)

(All method identifiers in snake*case with ARC-4 type signatures. ARC-1594 methods are namespaced with `arc1594*`. Simplification: this core profile drops explicit partition parameters; partition-aware functionality is delegated to ARC-1410.)

- `arc1594_issue(to: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes)`
- `arc1594_redeem(amount: uint256, data: bytes)` (caller/self redemption)
- `arc1594_redeemFrom(from: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes)` (owner/governance or holder-authorized redemption)
- `arc1594_set_issuable(flag: bool)` (owner toggles global issuance enable switch)
- `arc1594_is_issuable() -> (flag: bool)` (readonly global issuance enable flag)
- `arc1594_transfer_with_data(to: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes)` (standard transfer emitting/accepting opaque metadata)
- `arc1594_transfer_from_with_data(from: address, to: address, amount: uint256, data: bytes)` (allowance/operator transfer with metadata)

Partitioned behavior (if needed) MUST be layered by simultaneously implementing ARC-1410; ARC-1594 then operates on the default/unrestricted partition implicitly.

Note: Per-account KYC / lockup admin setter methods have been removed from the core; such compliance layers MAY be specified by an extension ARC to keep ARC-1594 minimal.

### 3.2 Codes

Return codes:

- `0` Success
- `10` SenderNotEligible
- `11` RecipientNotEligible
- `12` PartitionRestricted
- `13` AmountExceedsPartitionBalance
- `14` GlobalTransferHalted
- `15` LockupActive
- `16` DocumentDisclosureRequired
  (Code 20 removed in partitionless core profile; unknown partition is handled by ARC-1410 layer.)
- `30` InvalidSignatureOrAuth
- `40` InternalError

Codes MUST be logged as the first 8 bytes of a log entry or written to a well-known box/state key `last-val-code` keyed by sender address. Reason strings are optional and SHOULD be UTF-8.

### 3.4 State Model

Minimum required state keys / boxes:

- Global: `halt` (uint64; 1 = transfers disabled except controller)
- Local (per investor): `kyc` (uint64; 1 = eligible), `lockup-until` (uint64; round or timestamp), optional jurisdiction code `jur` (uint64)
- Boxes (optional extended): `elig-<addr>` for arbitrary packed compliance flags.

### 3.5 Authorization

Issuance / Redemption MUST be restricted to governance authority (Issuer) or delegated operators (multi-sig, logic signature) recorded in global state keys (`issuer`, `operator-<n>`). Validation is permissionless but enforces rules.

### 3.6 Events (Logging Conventions)

Implementations SHOULD log compact structured events (CBOR or msgpack) for indexing:

- arc1594_issue: tag 0x01 | addr | amount | partition (partition omitted in core partitionless profile)
- arc1594_redeem: tag 0x02 | addr | amount | partition (partition omitted in core partitionless profile)

### 3.7 Failure Semantics

If validation fails, the subsequent ARC-200 transfer MUST fail or be omitted. No partial state changes should misrepresent balances.

## 4. Security Considerations

- Ensure replay protection: include group ID or txn ID in validation ephemeral state so old approvals can't be reused.
- Prevent redemption of locked or escrowed partitions unless explicitly allowed.
- Use constant-time comparisons for signature attestations if verifying off-chain oracle attestations.

## 5. Reference Types

Suggested canonical encoding for address lists in boxes: msgpack array of raw 32-byte addresses.

## 6. Compliance Oracle Pattern (Optional)

An oracle signs `(from, to, amount, partition, round, expiryRound)`; contract verifies signature against authorized oracle key, bypassing on-chain local flags where policy allows.

## 7. Backwards Compatibility

Can coexist with a plain ARC-200 token; if wallet ignores validation flow, controller enforcement can still reverse unauthorized transfers (with ARC-1644) though this is discouraged for UX predictability.

## 8. Reference Implementation

To be provided in `/smart_contracts/security_token`.
